### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the DKMA-COVID19-Jan-States dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and apply various machine learning algorithms to predict daily increases in COVID-19 statistics (confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries). The classifiers used include Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, along with feature reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains statistics related to COVID-19 cases across US states for each day in January 2021, sourced from:
